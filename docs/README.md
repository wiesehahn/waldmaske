## `docs`

This folder is used by Github for 'Github Pages', which is the project website.

GitHub Pages will read the contents of your /docs directory, convert the index.md into HTML, and publish the results at your GitHub Pages URL under [](wiesehahn.github.io/forest-mask/)

Alternatively a HTML file (`index.html`) located here can also serve as project website.
