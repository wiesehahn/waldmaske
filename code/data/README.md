## `code\data`

Data provenance should be comprehensable, one way to achieve this is to write code to get data from the web or get it from a local database etc. If data is added programmatic like this the code should go here. 

Analysing data usually includes some kind of data processing where raw, external or intermediate data is altered. The code to do this processing is saved here and the result should be stored under `..\data\processed`.
