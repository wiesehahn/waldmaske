## `code\exploratory`

This folder contains files for intermediate analysis e.g to explore the data. Also it is a good practice to start with all research approaches here until the code has a mature state. Once the code reaches production state you can save the cleaned and commented version in one of the other subdirectories. 
You can keep all exploratory attempts here in case you have to go back or if someone wants to see how else you attempted to solve the problem.
