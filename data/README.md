## `data`

This directory houses all small (< 50 MB) data sets used for the analysis. 

If possible, data sets from individual experiments should be compiled in a long-form tidy format. This is important not only for your analysis, but for others who wish to reproduce your work. While you may have an intimate knowledge of your data and experimental structure, it may not be obvious to anyone else. It is much easier if you can combine the individual data sets into as few files as possible so only one or two files have to be read to perform the analysis and generate the figures. 

This is **not** a place to store all of your large (> 50 MB) data files. For accessibility of these large data sets, there are myriad online data repositories such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) which provide free storage and DOI generation.

This directory is broken into several subdirectories, each of which has a `README.md` file describing which kind of data it is used for.
